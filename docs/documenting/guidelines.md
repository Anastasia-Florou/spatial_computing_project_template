# Guidelines

* **File Size**: No file bigger than 50mb is recommended. No file bigger than 100mb is allowed.
* **Duplicates**: Do NOT include duplicates in your files.
* **Naming Convention**: Avoid using special characters or spaces in file and folder names. Instead, use "_" to separate words in the names.
* **Geometric Models** (.3dm, .obj, etc) should be compressed before being added to repository.
* **Video and Animation** files should not be included the repository. They should be uploaded to online video services (YouTube, Vimeo, etc). You should embed those video link in your documentation. (GIF files are allowed in your repo)

You can embed your only videos like this:
